# FIFO
This project implements a simple FIFO (First-In-First-Out) memory buffer using Verilog.
FIFO is a commonly used data structure in digital systems for buffering data between two subsystems operating at different speeds (like producer-consumer scenarios).

ðŸŽ¯ Features
Parameterized data width and depth

Separate read and write pointers

Full and empty flag detection

Synchronous write and read operations
